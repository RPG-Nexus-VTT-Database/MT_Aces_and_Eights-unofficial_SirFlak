A free font "faywood.ttf" was used in the A&8's book. 
I've used this font in my framework to make the chracter sheet feel more "official".
I've included it so you don't hvae to go looking online for the font.
On windows just right-click and hit install, or copy it to your fonts folder.

The Shot Clocks and Silos folder contains properly scaled silouttes and objects. Drag them into your background or object layer.
